Wanna see how fast pc's are nowadays? When you boot the program, type in a password you will like. All characters,numbers,letters are allowed. You will see how fast a pc can guess it.

## Preferences
boolean fullSpeed
Change it if you'd like to go to full speed mode. It will do the process without waiting a single time, while if it's false, it will be much more readable so you can see what happens.
